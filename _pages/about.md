### Hi, I’m Zhaoxi Liu, you can also call me Kevin. 

As a software engineer at Nexperia — where one in every ten chips worldwide is produced — I’m passionate about leveraging data and algorithms to tackle challenges and deliver real business value in the semiconductor industry.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve built a solid foundation for Data & AI: programming skills in multiple languages including Python and C++, data visualization toolkits like Matplotlib and Weka, hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, big data processing tools such as Apache Spark and Cloud platforms: AWS (EMR, S3, EC2). In my professional career, I had the opportunity to not only work on the equipment that makes the products but also work directly on production lines at multiple back-end sites, collaborating closely with operators and engineers to optimize processes. In my journey I found that the most effective way of learning is through the iterative cycle of build - measure - learn : acquiring new knowledge, translating it into practical solutions, testing them quickly, and refining through continuous improvement.

Driven by strong belief in the transformative potential of AI for the semiconductor industry, I am actively seeking out projects that expand my skills while driving the adoption of cutting-edge technologies.

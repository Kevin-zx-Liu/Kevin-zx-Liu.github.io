### Hi, I’m Zhaoxi Liu, you can also call me Kevin. 

I am an aspiring software engineer working at Nexperia where 1 out of every 10 chips in the world are produced. My passion is to leverage data and algorithms to solve challenges and bring real business value in semiconductor industry. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve built a strong toolkit for data science: proficient programming skills in Python and C++, expertise in data visualization, hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, and big data processing tools such as Apache Spark. I had the opportunity to not only work on the equipment that builds the devices but also work directly on production lines at multiple back-end sites, collaborating closely with operators and engineers to optimize processes. In my journey I found that the most effective way of learning is through the iterative cycle of build - measure - learn : acquiring new knowledge, translating it into practical solutions, testing them quickly, and refining through continuous improvement.

Driven by strong belief in the transformative potential of AI for the semiconductor industry, I am actively seeking out projects that expand my skills while driving the adoption of cutting-edge technologies.

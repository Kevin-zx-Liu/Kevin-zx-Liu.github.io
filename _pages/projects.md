## Large scale data process with Spark and AWS

In this lab project, we developed an application to process the OpenStreetMap and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model data sets to generate insight in predicting the consequences of global sea level rising. 


## Thesis project: Unsupervised Wafer Map Failure Pattern Recognition with Contrastive Learning



In this project, my goal is:

1. To prove that by employing **Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (SSCL)**, we can maximize the utility of the vast amount of unlabeled wafer test data for various downstream tasks. And we can improve the quality of representation learning for **Wafer Map Failure Pattern Recognition(WMFPR)** by adapting optimal configuration for the SSCL model.
2.  To demonstrate how the proposed method can improve the production quality and overall yield. And to give insight on how can we apply the extracted features to help engineers identify similar issues.
